 How the Program Works

1. The program runs inside a continuous loop.
2. User selects an operation.
3. The program takes:
   - **One input** for `sq` and `!`
   - **Two inputs** for all other operations
4. The calculator function processes the result.
5. The program ends when the user types **exit**.

 Algorithm

1. Start the program.
2. Display available operations.
3. Read user's choice.
4. If choice is `exit`, stop execution.
5. If choice is `sq` or `!`, take one number.
6. Otherwise, take two numbers.
7. Perform the operation using conditions.
8. Display the result.
9. Repeat.
