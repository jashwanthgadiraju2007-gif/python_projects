 Age Calculator

This Python program calculates a person's exact age in years, months, and days based on their date of birth.  
It uses the datetime module to compare the user's birth date with today's date and determine the correct age, including month and day adjustments.

This project demonstrates:
- Working with the datetime module  
- Date comparison and difference calculation  
- Conditional logic  
- Basic user input handling  

Features
- Calculates age in years, months, and days  
- Automatically adjusts negative days and months  
- Accepts user input in DD/MM/YYYY format  
- Uses only built-in Python libraries  
- Simple and accurate

 How the Program Works
1. User enters their birth day, month, and year.  
2. The program retrieves today's date.  
3. It subtracts the birth date from today's date.  
4. If days or months are negative, the program adjusts them correctly.  
5. The final age is displayed in years, months, and days.

Sample Output

Enter birth day (DD): 12  
Enter birth month (MM): 3  
Enter birth year (YYYY): 2005  

Your Age: 19 years, 8 months, 20 days
